hideIt.sh
=========

`hideIt.sh` will move windows out of your screen and show them again  
when you mouse over a predefined region or the window itself.

Initially I wrote this script to imitate gnome-shells systray in combination with [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar).  
This sript however was very much bound to my environment.  

Eventually I decided it would be a great idea to share it with the unix community  
and re-wrote the whole thing, making it more generic and (hopefully) userfriendly.

## Requirements
1. xdotool
2. xwininfo
3. xev


## Installation
### Manual
First, make sure all [requirements](#requirements) are installed.  
Than, simply download [hideIt.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tadly/hideIt.sh/master/hideIt.sh) to a location of your choice and use it.
```bash
# Using wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tadly/hideIt.sh/master/hideIt.sh

# Using curl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tadly/hideIt.sh/master/hideIt.sh -o hideIt.sh
```

### Arch Linux
hideIt.sh can be found in the [aur](hideit.sh-git)
```bash
# Using aura
aura -A hideit.sh-git

# Using pacaur
pacaur -S hideit.sh-git

# Using pakku
pakku -S hideit.sh-git

# Using paru
paru -S hideit.sh-git

# Using pikaur
pikaur -S hideit.sh-git

# Using trizen
trizen -S hideit.sh-git

# Using yay
yay -S hideit.sh-git
```


## Usage
You can read some help text right?
```bash
./hideIt.sh --help
```


## Examples
### Polybar systray
A standalone systray configuration could look something like this:
```ini
[bar/systray]
# As small as possible, polybar will resize it when items get added
width = 1

# Whatever fits your needs
height = 40

# Bottom left to imitate gnome-shells systray
bottom = true

# REQUIRED for us to be able to move the window
override-redirect = true

modules-right = placeholder

tray-position = left
tray-maxsize = 16
tray-padding = 8
tray-transparent = false
tray-background = #282C34

[module/placeholder]
# Just a dummy module as polybar always requires at least one amodule
type = custom/script
width = 1
```

Now lets hide it:
```bash
# Find the windows name
$ xprop | grep WM_NAME
WM_NAME(STRING) = "Polybar tray window"

# Hide it
$ ./hideIt.sh --name '^Polybar tray window$' --region 0x1080+10+-40
```

### Polybar (my main bar)
You don't need my whole polybar config right? Right!  

I only did this for the purpose of testing while working on this script but...   I think I like it! :)

### Nautilus?
Heck... why stop at the statusbar amiright?

*Disclaimer: Yes, I know, this is getting silly but I gotta demonstrate how versatile this is* ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


### By keyboard (SIGUSR1)
Instead of using your mouse to trigger the show/hide event, you can also send a `SIGUSR1` to the process.  
For this to work, the process needs to be started using the `-S, --signal` argument.  

This will than **ignore** the mouse completely and only listen for `SIGUSR1` at which it will either show or hide the window.  

For example:
```bash
$ ./hideIt.sh --name drop-down-terminal --signal
```

To send a `SIGUSR1`-signal you can use `hideIt.sh` itself:
```bash
$ ./hideIt.sh --name drop-down-terminal --toggle
```

or use plain old `kill` itself:
```bash
$ kill -SIGUSR1 <pid>
```

## Q&A
#### *How does the script determine when to trigger?*
Depends on whether you use `--region`, `--hover` or `--signal`.
 * `--region` does polling and the interval can be changed via `--interval`
 * `--hover` uses **xev** to monitor the window and is therefore event based
 * `--signal` waits for a **SIGUSR1**

#### *My system tray goes nuts when using `--hover`! What the heck?*
This is because each systray element (the icon) is its own window resulting  
in *entry -> leave -> entry -> ...* events due to the window underneath your  
cursor constantly changing.  
To work around this, use `--region` or `--signal` instead.
